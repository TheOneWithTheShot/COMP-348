gameplay
a bird story is a short video-game in which the player controls an imaginative young boy who is ignored by the majority of the other characters and throughout the whole game; all characters except the boy and a few others have ghost-like bodies.[3] when the boy finds an injured bird, he becomes happier and begins to notice more people, and his introversion lowers.[citation needed] the map is as though the game is a recollection of memories, instead of being in real time. the player could be in a park which leads into a hallway.[4] in a kotaku review, the lack of dialogue was compared to the expression "show, don't tell".[4]

plot
though never stated in the game, the protagonist of the game is colin. colin is an only child, whose parents are almost never home due to working long hours away. his parents are never seen, communicating with colin mostly through written notes, but still care deeply for him. nevertheless, colin is very lonely, as he has no friends and is frequently chided by his teacher for never paying attention in class. one day, colin finds a bird with an injured wing being attacked by a badger. colin chases off the badger. the bird later winds up hiding in colin's backpack, and colin eventually takes it to the vet. after the vet bandages up the broken wing, colin sneaks the bird away while the vet is looking for a bird cage. colin spends the next several days taking care of the bird on his balcony and playing with it in the woods, dodging both the vet and the landlord, who forbids pets within the apartment complex where colin's family lives, to maintain custody over the bird.

as colin's relationship with the bird deepens, colin becomes less introverted and begins to connect more with his classmates. after several days, colin becomes aware that his time with his bird are coming to an end. as he continues to play in the woods and hills with the bird, he daydreams of creating a massive paper plane using pages from his green book that he can summon at will. after a few fantasy flights, colin returns home and takes off the bird's bandages. the bird, now fully recovered, flies off with a new mate. though saddened, colin is grateful to have had a friend for the first time. the experience would come to define colin for the rest of his life, as depicted in finding paradise.
