You might need to install pandas and tabulate tools in order
to generate the report since it consists of generating the 
required table to show the data in the server.

To install both follow these steps:
- In the terminal enter the following:
1. python -m pip install --upgrade pip
2. Followed by pip install pandas
3. Followed by pip install tabulate

client.py & server.py need to be running. You can either 
use Windows' terminal or run the code from the IDE.

It is preferable to use Windows' terminal by going in the root
of the project and writing "cmd" in the path of File Explorer.

It is preferable because I have used a function that clears
the screen so that there isn't too much stuff on the terminal.
